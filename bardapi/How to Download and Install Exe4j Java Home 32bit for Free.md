If you downloaded the setup executable, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. If you downloaded the ZIP archive, extract it to a folder of your choice. In both cases, you will need to enter a license key to activate exe4j. If you have purchased install4j, you can use the same license key for exe4j. If you don't have a license key, you can evaluate exe4j without any time limit, but the executables will show evaluation warnings and services will stop after 30 minutes.
 
## Step 3: Create a Java launcher with exe4j
 
To create a Java launcher with exe4j, run the exe4j wizard from the Start menu or from the installation folder. You will see a welcome screen where you can choose to create a new project or open an existing one. Click on "New Project" and select the type of launcher you want to create (GUI application, console application, service or browser-based application). Then follow the steps of the wizard to configure your launcher settings, such as main class, class path, JVM options, splash screen, icon, etc. You can also use the advanced mode to customize your launcher further.
 
When you are done with the wizard, click on "Finish" and save your project file. Then click on "Compile" to generate your executable file. You can test your launcher by clicking on "Run". You can also edit your project file later by opening it with the exe4j wizard or by using a text editor.
